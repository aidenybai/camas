### About us

Camas Codes challenges **young programmers, designers, and builders** to create **impactful projects**. We're a club at [Camas High School](https://camas.wednet.edu/schools/chs/) that seeks to accelerate students that are passionate about making cool stuff and improve accessibility to coding.

### DROP

- **Shock factor**: Generates a lot of hype, "something that gets everyone talking"
- **High community impact**: Makes tangible change to Camas High School

If you're accepted, you receive:

- Up to **$1000** in funding
