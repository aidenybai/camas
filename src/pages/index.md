### About us

Right now, I'm exploring **next generation** user interfaces with
[**✦ Million.js**](https://millionjs.org/), which won **3rd place** grand award in Systems Software at [ISEF 2022](https://www.societyforscience.org/press-release/regeneron-isef-full-awards-2022/#:~:text=SOFT037).

In the summer of 2022, I'll be interning at [**▲ Vercel**](https://vercel.com) to help work on projects in the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) ecosystem and learn more about the bleeding _edge_ of web
development.

### Previously

I won the **2nd place** grand award in Systems Software at
[ISEF 2021](https://www.societyforscience.org/press-release/2021-regeneron-isef-grand-awards/#:~:text=SOFT031) with my research on [**Lucia.js**](https://projectboard.world/isef/project/soft031---lucia) out of **1.8k+ students** around the world.

I pioneered [**KBowl**](https://kbowl.aidenybai.com) (virtual [Knowledge Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Bowl) events) during the COVID-19 lockdown. I helped organize the K-12 leagues for Washington State, consisting of
**30+ schools, 40+ teachers and 1k+ students** throughout
2020 and 2021.

### More

I like blasting music with my windows down on the highway, chugging fruit tea boba, and composing my [**thoughts**](/thoughts) in my free time.
